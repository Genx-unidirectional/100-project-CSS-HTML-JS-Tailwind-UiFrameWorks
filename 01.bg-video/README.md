### Video

# Problem

--> When we set the video in main file and make it absolute and set it's dimension to cover overall width and height of it's parent this doesn't happen and it showed up half of the page.

# Solution

-->Instead setting height and width like that we can set it using media queries so that it cover entire block rather than half of the block.
